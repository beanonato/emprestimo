# Loan Simulator :moneybag:

### Description 
Imagine that you work in a finance company and need to develop a loan scheme. You must ask the income, age and amount the customer wants to borrow.

As rules are:
1. Only approve for customers who are between 21 and 55 years old;
2. Income must be greater than R $ 1000.00;
3. The loan amount cannot be greater than 15x the client's salary amount;
4. We do not lend less than R $ 500.00.

Once the loan has been approved, ask how many installments the customer wants to install the loan amount into.
We split between 3 and 24 times.

Calculate and <b>display on the console</b> that the loan was approved, the number of installments and the value of each installment considering that our interest rate is 8.5%. :money_with_wings:
